# Hey, I'm Jaime 👋

**Electronics Engineer & Startup Founder**

I started very young getting obsessed with tech, it seemed to be some kind of magic. From mechanics to programming, I've always been a geek about it and how to apply it to solve real-world problems.

## My Journey

Studied Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Spent 3 years at **MAD Formula Team** designing electronics for autonomous racing cars and competing all across Europe. My thesis focused on autonomous vehicle control systems, and we even competed internationally.

While finishing my degree, I started learning about auditing work and doing small automations. That's when I realized all the knowledge I had acquired could be applied to help auditors deal with compliance and validations.

So in November 2025, I co-founded **G2F**.

## What I'm Building Now

At **[G2F](https://g2f.io)**, we're building the AI-powered workflow automation platform I wish had existed when I was doing those small automations. An ecosystem tailored to auditors and compliance professionals to power automations and keep up with the era.

I'm still hands-on with everything:

**AI & Backend**

- LLM & ML integration for document processing, validation and classification
- RAG systems with pgvector for intelligent retrieval
- Agentic workflows with autonomous task execution
- Go services + Python workers
- Temporal for distributed workflow orchestration (handling 500+ concurrent workflows)

**Frontend & Infrastructure**

- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- AWS EKS, Kubernetes, Helm
- Pulumi (Infrastructure as Code)
- ArgoCD (GitOps)
- OAuth integrations with 13+ platforms

**From My Racing Days**

- Embedded systems (C/C++, STM32)
- PCB design (Altium Designer)
- CANbus, sensor integration
- Control systems and state estimation
- Real-time autonomous driving systems
