# Hey, I'm Jaime 👋

**Electronics Engineer & Startup Founder**

I started very young getting obsessed with tech, it seemed to be some kind of magic. From mechanics to programming, I've always been a geek about it and how to apply it to solve real-world problems.

## My Journey

Studied Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Spent 3 years at **MAD Formula Team** designing electronics for autonomous racing cars and competing all across Europe. My thesis focused on autonomous vehicle control systems, and we even competed internationally.

While finishing my degree, I started learning about auditing work and doing small automations. That's when I realized all the knowledge I had acquired could be applied to help auditors deal with compliance and validations.

So in November 2025, I co-founded **G2F**.

## What I'm Building Now

At **[G2F](https://g2f.io)**, we're building the AI-powered workflow automation platform I wish had existed when I was doing those small automations. An ecosystem tailored to auditors and compliance professionals to power automations and keep up with the era.
